\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, after comparing the data obtained on the simulation and with the mathematical tools we can see a almost complete match with only some minor diferences in the last digit. The difference can be despised due to its insignificance because both tools use the same methods to solve the circuit so an equal output itâ€™s expected.
