% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing several resistors $R_n$, two current sources, $I_d$ and $I_b$, with one of them beeing dependant, and two tension sources, $V_a$ and $V_c$, with the latter beeing dependant. The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:Circuit}.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
