\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


\par The goal of the laboratory was to create a circuit that would convert an input AC voltage of 230V with a frequency of 50Hz to and output DC voltage of 12V with a frequency of 50Hz. We used a voltage regulator, an envelope detector and a transformer in order to do this. The tranformer was represented with an alternated, independent voltage source that would connect to the envelope detector and would reduce the input voltage by a ratio of n:1, with n beeing any rational number as large as the number of coils in any real transformer, with the ration beeing decided during the simulation and theoretical analysis..\par
To evaluate the circuit a merit classification was created. This merit system took into account several thing like the cost of the components and the ripple and average amplitude of the output voltage. The merit of the circuit will be determined according to the following equation: 
\begin {equation}
	 MERIT = \frac{1}{cost*(ripple_{reg} + |average_{reg} - 12| + 10^{-6})}   	
	\label{eq:i1}
\end{equation}

The cost of the components are the following: cost of resistors = 1 monetary unit per k0hm, cost of capacitors = 1 MU/uF and cost of diodes = 0.1 MU per diode. The voltage source that represents the transformer was not taken into account in terms of cost.
 
The general layout of the circuit that was implemented can be seen in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:circuit_t3}}. In the next sections the actual architecture implemented will be analyzed in greater detail.\par

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we present a theoretical analysis of the circuit. Here, we analyse the circuit using theoretical models adjusted for the diodes, so we can predict the output of the Envelope Detector
and Voltage Regulator circuits. We calculate the output DC level and the
voltage ripple and the plots for the voltages at the output of the Envelope Detector and Voltage Regulator circuits are presented, as well as the plot for the output deviation (subtracting a factor of 12 to the output voltage), of the output of the regulator. 
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, we analyse the circuit by
simulating it using the program Ngspice. In Ngspice the default model for the diode was used. We simulated the AC/DC converter for 10 periods and measured the voltage average and ripple using built in functions of the program. We also made the same plots produced in the theoretical analysis in this section, also by simulation. Our conclusions of this study can be shown in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, where we compare the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis} with the simulation results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:simulation}.
