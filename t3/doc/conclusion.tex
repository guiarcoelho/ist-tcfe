\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This laboratory assignment had the purpose of building a circuit which could transform an AC input of 230V voltage and 50HZ frequency into an output of 12V with the minimum cost and ripple. This objective has been sucessufuly achieved.\par 
This project provided us the opportunity to understand how the envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits work and also, how to improve their efficieny. We're also able to analyse carefully the working principle of an AC/DC converter. \par
In order to analyse the circuit theoreticaly \textit{Ocatve} was used as well as all the Kirchoff's equations and diode models that support this analysis. 
The simulation was done using \textit{Ngspice}. \par
The final value for the Merit obtained was 0.26.
